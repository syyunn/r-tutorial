# Create an identity matrix

## Matrix operations
# Addition and subtraction
A + B
B - A
A - B
C + B

# Multiplication by a scalar

A

B

A %*% B

A %*% C

# Does this work?
C %*% A

# What about this?
A %*% C

# Can we make it work with some function of C in front?
t(C) %*% A

# Create a vector of length 3
V <- c(7, 9, 10) # r contains vector "vertically"

### Inverse ###
