### Pset 1

# Your name here:

# What should you do before you start working on R??

## Functions

# Increasing the maximum. Let's go against our wishes and increase inequeality.
# Create a function that will select the biggest value from a vector and add a number to it.
# Set the default value for that number to be equal to 2

# Try it with the following vector

vector1<- c(1:11)

## Working with datasets

# Install and open the packages that you will need



# Get your data: load the dataset "antidumping.csv" using read.csv()


# What kind of object is your dataset?


# Get a sense of the data by checking the names of each of the variables,
# looking at the dimensions, and


# What are the dimensions of the data?


# Take a look at the first lines


# How many unique countries in this dataset


# Make a subset of data for all observations for Mexico


# What is the max number of antidumping cases that Mexico has recorded in this data?


# In what year(s) did Mexico have this max value of antidumping cases? Select the rows
# of this subset of data


# What is the average gdp per capita that Mexico recorded during this period?


# Order the mexican data by the value of their GDP per capita, but make it decreasing
